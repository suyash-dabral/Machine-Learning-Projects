# Image Classification Model with MobileNetV2

This project demonstrates the creation of an image classification model using a pre-trained **MobileNetV2** architecture. The model is designed to classify images into predefined categories and includes an example of how to classify a sample image with added Gaussian noise for robustness.

## About

Image classification is a key task in computer vision, aiming to assign a label to an image based on its content. This project utilizes a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify images into specified categories. The dataset used consists of images with associated labels, making it suitable for benchmarking classification algorithms.

## Features

- **Multi-class Classification:** Classifies images into multiple predefined categories.
- **Data Augmentation:** Incorporates techniques like Gaussian noise addition for improved robustness.
- **Sample Image Testing:** Option to test the model with a sample image for quick evaluations.
